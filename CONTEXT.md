# Project Context

## Product

This repository is a template. Generated projects should replace this section with their product goals, users, and constraints.

## Architecture

Maison-style full-stack TypeScript monorepo:

- Bun is the package manager and runtime for scripts.
- Turborepo coordinates workspace tasks.
- Next.js powers `apps/web`.
- Prisma/Postgres lives in `packages/database`.
- Shared data/config lives in `packages/data`.
- Shared TypeScript compiler settings live in `packages/config-typescript`.

## Current conventions

- Ultracite/Biome for linting and formatting.
- Commitlint with Conventional Commits.
- Husky local gates for commit, commit message, and push checks.
- Gitleaks and Typos in local hooks and CI.
- GitHub Issues and PRs carry repo continuation state.

## Non-goals

- Product-specific models, UI, copy, integrations, or payment flows.
- Mandatory CI builds; Vercel previews can own build validation unless the generated repo opts in.
